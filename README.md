# Java DesignPattern Observer:


For a homework assignment, we needed to implement a observer pattern and 
make different JPanels interact with each other. 
We needed to create 3 rectangles that have different colors change in size based on what the user inputs in a text field.
They will go both on the same frame.

The code in this file demostrates my ability to do this.
